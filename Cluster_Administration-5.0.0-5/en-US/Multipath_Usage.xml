<screen>    RHEL4 U3 Device Mapper Multipath UsageOverview------------Device Mapper Multipath (DM-MP) allows nodes to route I/O overmultiple paths to a storage controller. A path refers to theconnection from an HBA port to a storage controller port. As pathsfail and new paths come up, DM-MP reroutes the I/O over theavailable paths.When there are multiple paths to a storage controller, each pathappears as a separate device.  DM-MP creates a new device on top ofthose devices. For example, a node with two HBAs attached to a storagecontroller with two ports via a single unzoned FC switch sees fourdevices: /dev/sda, /dev/sdb, /dev/sdc, and /dev/sdd. DM-MP creates asingle device, /dev/mpath/mpath1 that reroutes I/O to those fourunderlying devices. DM-MP consists of the following components:o dm-multipath kernel module -- This module reroutes I/O and fails  over paths and path groups.o multipath command -- This command configures, lists, and removes  multipath  devices. The command is run in rc.sysinit during startup,   and by udev, whenever a block device    is added.o multipathd daemon -- This daemon monitors paths, checking to see  if faulty paths have been fixed. As paths come back up, multipathd  may also initiate path group switches to ensure that the optima  path group is being used. Also, it is possible to interactively  modify a multipath device. o kpartx command -- This command creates Device Mapper devices for the  partitions on a device. It is necessary to use this command for DOS-  based partitions with DM-MP.DM-MP works with a variety of storage arrays. Itauto-configures the following storage arrays:o 3PARdata VVo Compaq HSV110o Compaq MSA1000o DDN SAN DataDirectoro DEC HSG80o EMC SYMMETRIXo EMC CLARiiONo FSC CentricStoro HITACHI DF400o HITACHI DF500o HITACHI DF600o HP HSV110o HP HSV210o HP A6189Ao HP Open-o IBM 3542o IBM ProFibre 4000Ro NETAPPo SGI TP9100o SGI TP9300o SGI TP9400o SGI TP9500o STK OPENstroage D280o SUN StorEdge 3510o SUN T4Storage arrays not included in the list may require entries in the/etc/multipath.conf file.NOTE: Some storage arrays require special handling of I/O errors and      path-group switching. Those require separate hardware handler      kernel modules. Terms and Concepts---------------------Hardware Handler:    A kernel module that performs hardware-specific actions when    switching path groups and dealing with I/O errors.Path:    The connection from an HBA port to a storage controller port for    a LUN. Each path appears as a separate device. Paths can be in    various states (refer to &#34;Path States&#34;).Path States:    ready  - Path is able to handle I/O requests.    shaky  - Path is up, but temporarily not available for normal             operations.    faulty - Path is unable to handle I/O requests.    ghost  - Path is a passive path, on an active/passive             controller.            NOTE: The shaky and ghost states only exist for certain              storage arrays.Path Group:    A grouping of paths. With DM-MP, only one path group--the    active path group--receives I/O at any time. Within a path    group, DM-MP selects which ready path should receive I/O in    a round robin fashion. Path groups can be in various states    (refer to &#34;Path Group States&#34;).Path Group States:    active   - Path group currently receiving I/O requests.    enabled  - Path groups to try if the active path group has no paths               in the ready state.    disabled - Path groups to try if the active path group and all           enabled path groups have no paths in the active state.            NOTE: The disabled state only exists for certain storage arrays.Path Priority:    Each path can have a priority assigned to it by a callout program.    Path priorities can be used to group paths by priority and change    their relative weights for the round robin path selector.Path Group Priority:    Each path group has a priority that is equal to the sum of the    priorities of all the non-faulty paths in the group. By default, the    multipathd daemon tries to ensure that the path group with the    highest priority is always in the active state.Failover:    When I/O to a path fails, the dm-multipath module tries to switch to     an enabled path group. If there are no enabled path groups with    any paths in the ready state, dm-multipath tries to switch to a    disabled path group. If necessary, dm-multipath runs the hardware    handler for the multipath device.Failback:    At regular intervals, multipathd checks the current priority of    all path groups. If the current path group is not the highest    priority path group, multipathd reacts according to the failback    mode. By default, multipathd immediately switches to the highest    priority path group. Other options for multipathd are to (a) wait    for a user-defined length of time (for the path groups to stabilize)    and then switch or (b) for multipathd to do nothing and wait for    manual intervention.  Failback can be forced at any time by    running the multipath command.Multipath device:    The multipath device is the device mapper device created by    dm-multipath. A multipath device can be identified by either    its WWID or its alias. A multipath device has one or more path    groups. It also has numerous attributes defined in the    following file:    /usr/share/doc/device-mapper-multipathd-0.4.5/multipath.conf.annotated alias:    The alias is the name of a multipath device. By default, the    alias is set to the WWID. However, by setting the    &#34;user_friendly_names&#34; configuration option, the alias is set to a    unique name of the form mpath&lt;n&gt;. The alias name can also be    explicitly set for each multipath device in the configuration file.    NOTE: While the alias in guaranteed to be unique on a node, it          is not guaranteed to be the same on all nodes using the          multipath device. Also, it may change.WWID:    The WWID (World Wide Identifier) is an identifier for the    multipath device that is guaranteed to be globally unique and    unchanging. It is determined by the getuid callout program.Using DM-MP------------------------------------Initial setup:1. If it is not already installed. Install the device-mapper-multipath   package.2. Edit /etc/multipath.conf. For new installations, all devices are   blacklisted. The default blacklist is listed in the commented out   section of /etc/multipath.conf.  If you comment out or delete   the following lines in /etc/multipath.conf, the default blacklist    takes effect:   devnode_blacklist {           devnode &#34;*&#34;   }   For some conditions, that may not be sufficient. If DM-MP is   multipathing devices that you do not want it to work on, you can   blacklist the devices by either device name or WWID.   NOTE: It is safest to blacklist individual devices by WWID, because         their device names may change.    Several other configuration options are detailed later in this   document. To check the  effects of configuration changes, you can   do a dry run with the following command:   # multipath -v2 -d3. Set the multipathd init script to run at boot time. by issuing   the commands   # chkconfig --add multipathd   # chkconfig multipathd on4. start dm-multipath (This is only necessary the first time.  On   reboot, this should happen automatically).   # multipath   # /etc/init.d/multipathd startAfter initial setup, all access to the multipathed storage should gothrough the multipath device.Configuration File:Many features of DM-MP are configurable using the configuration file,/etc/multipath.conf.For a complete list of all options with descriptions, refer to/usr/share/doc/device-mapper-multipathd-0.4.5/multipath.conf.annotatedThe configuration file is divided into four sections: system defaults,blacklisted devices (devnode_blacklist), per storage array model settings(devices), and per multipath device settings (multipaths).  The permultipath device settings are used for the multipath device with amatching &#34;wwid&#34; value. The per storage array model settings are usedfor all multipath devices with matching &#34;vendor&#34; and &#34;product&#34; values.To determine the attributes of a multipath device, first the permultipath settings are checked, then the per controller settings, thenthe system defaults.  The blacklisted device section is describedsetup step 2.NOTE: There are compiled-in defaults for the &#34;defaults&#34;,      &#34;devnode_blacklist&#34;, and &#34;devices&#34; sections of the      configuration file. To see what these are, refer to the      following file:/usr/share/doc/device-mapper-multipathd-0.4.5/multipath.conf.syntheticIf you are using one of the storage arrays listed in the precedingtext (in &#34;Overview&#34;), you probably do not need to modify the &#34;devices&#34;subsection. If you are using a simple disk enclosure, the defaultsshould work. If you are using a storage array that is notlisted, you may need to create a &#34;devices&#34; subsection for your array.Explanation of output-----------------------When you create, modify, or list a multipath device, you get aprintout of the current device setup. The format is as follows.For each multipath device:action_if_any: alias (wwid_if_different_from_alias)[size][features][hardware_handler]For each path group:&#92;_ scheduling_policy [path_group_priority_if_known][path_group_status_if_known]For each path: &#92;_ host:channel:id:lun devnode major:minor [path_status] [dm_status_if_known]NOTE: The preceding lines for path group and path      were broken because of print limitations.The dm status (dm_status_if_known) is like the path status(path_status), but from the kernel's point of view.  The dm statushas two states: &#34;failed&#34;, which is analogous to &#34;faulty&#34;,and &#34;active&#34; which covers all other path states. Occasionally,the path state and the dm state of a device will temporarilynot agree. NOTE: When a multipath device is being created or modified, thepath group status and the dm status are not known.  Also, thefeatures are not always correct. When a multipath device is being isted, the path group priority is not known.Restrictions---------------DM-MP cannot be run on either the root or boot device.Other Sources of information----------------------------Configuration file explanation:/usr/share/doc/device-mapper-multipathd-0.4.5/multipath.conf.annotatedUpstream documentation:http://christophe.varoqui.free.fr/wiki/wakka.php?wiki=Homemailing list:dm-devel@redhat.comSubscribe to this from https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/dm-devel.The list archives are at https://www.redhat.com/archives/dm-devel/Man pages:multipath.8, multipathd.8, kpartx.8 mpath_ctl.8</screen></appendix>
